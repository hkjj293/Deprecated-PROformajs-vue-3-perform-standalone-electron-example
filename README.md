# proformajs-vue3-perform-standalone-electron-example

An example usage of proformajs-vue3-perform using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

This repo uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces)
to create two npm libraries:
* proformajs-vue3 - components for creating protocols and running enactments
* proformajs-vue3-perform - a subset of the components needed to run enactments

This repo uses CI to:
* check the code format with prettier
* check the code with a linter
* check for dependency vulnerabilities
* run behavioural tests automatically

The original component work for this project can be found at https://gitlab.com/openclinical/proformajs-vue3

## Development

You'll need to run ``npx vite build --watch`` in the package that your working
in order to see your changes reflected in the demo as you make them.

### Committing changes

Before creating a merge request or pushing your changes to main please ensure
that your code is linted and formatted and that the tests all run green.  
Also ensure that a fresh install has no security vulnerabilities.

# Skeleton

The skeleton for this project was created with ``npm init vue@latest`` (3.4.27)
which generated the rest of this README.

Workspaces were then created with ``npm init -w .packages/map`` etc.
